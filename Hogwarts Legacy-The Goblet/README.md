Hey Prefects [v2](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/123334373) here this is [THE GOBLET](https://next.nexusmods.com/hogwartslegacy/collections/uehwil) for **Hogwarts Legacy**.

<details><summary>ABOUT ME</summary>
Hey Chooms! This is a little bit about me and why I started curating mod collections

Back in the 90s, I was a young kid, and I never slowed down for more than two seconds.&#x20;

But this all changed one day when I visited my cousin he had a Super Nintendo!!! and I fell in love, from that moment on I knew gaming was something that called out to me.

So when my parents bought my sister and i our own console (Playstation) I was over the moon, long nights playing Crash Bandicoot, Spyro and Gran Turismo you can't beat these memories.

Skip forward 10 years and games like Red Dead Redemption, GTA Vice City and Need for Speed these games only solidified my love of gaming even more. Like many of us, it gave us a way to escape and let our imagination run wild.

Skip forward to the current day. The time when we can create new experiences in the games that we already love what could be better than this? Modding is really a cool way to add so much more. But it's not always easy to get all those cool mods to work together with no issues. This inspired me to combine my passion for helping people, with a desire to make games that use mods and work as seamlessly as they can.

So join us choombah and come along for the ride.

- If you are crashing or items are not working properly this is because you have 2 conflicting mods.  At this stage, there is no way to fix this due to the way the files work in the game. To fix these issues you need to determine which mods are affected and then uninstall one of them.

Always double-check Vortex to make sure it uninstalled/installed something properly during an update. If you are having any issues with crashing or mods not loading you can do the following.

## ![img](https://i.imgur.com/Pwo08kq.png)Features

> This is a complete overhaul of Hogwarts Legacy to go with my mod collection THE GOBLET. This mod came about for a few reasons. But the main reason was a lot of the game balancing mods available affect the same file so you can't have more than two mods at one time without using the mod merger to merge them and this can sometimes be a headache. The Goblet Overhaul makes it easier with an easy-to-install mod menu and many presets for you to choose from.
