If you don't see the Tools in **Vortex** this could be one of 2 issues.

**1**) The most common issue is Vortex being confused, so you can try to **Purge** and **Deploy** the Mods in **Vortex** a few times if this still doesn't show the Tools close and reopen **Vortex**.

**2**) Sometimes you need to relink **Vortex** to a tool.
or sometimes the toolbar isn't enabled.

- Go to the **"dashboard"** tab in **Vortex**.

- Scroll down until you see **"tools"**.

Make sure it's enabled.
If it is but the tools still arnt showing do the following

- Click the 3 dots next to the tool you need to relink ie Reshade. and select **"edit"**

- Now select **"target"** and browse to where you have the tool installed this will be in the main Starfield directory.

<summary>In Vortex it says 'Incompatible mods enabled'</summary>

![img](https://i.imgur.com/gF9VG11.png)

This is because you have enabled 2 conflicting Wand Mods.

All you have to do is disable the variant of the Wand you don't want.
