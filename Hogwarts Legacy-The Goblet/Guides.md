I've been building Pcs for a few years now and have picked up a few tips and tricks along the way. You can also check out my builds on our Discord.

I can connect to your Pc via a remote connection [Team Viewer]() and optimize your Pc for gaming. 

I use a few tools and methods which I will explain here. These tools/programs are lightweight and will not take up many resources in the background. These tools are used widely by the Pc community and are well known.

All links to these tools will be listed below so you can check them out for yourself.

All of this I offer free of charge. The only thing I ask is for you to **Endorse** and support our collections. It really means a lot to us.


### MSI afterburner

This is an overclocking tool but it does much more. With this tool, I can set the following.

- Custom fan curve this will help with **GPU** temps.

- Unlock the voltage control on the **GPU** this helps maintain higher clock speeds for the **GPU**.



### RTSS Riva Statistics Tuner

This is a hardware monitoring tool that works alongside **MSI Afterburner**.

1) This allows monitoring of all **GPU** parameters including an **FPS** counter, Temp readings, **FPS** cap and much much more



### ISLC Intelligent Standby List Cleaner

This help to clear out the standby list in Windows in turn freeing up Memory **RAM** the benefits of this tool are fewer stutters in game and maintaining a steady fps.



### Quick CPU

Quick CPU is a program that was designed to fine-tune and monitor important CPU and System parameters such as **CPU** Temperature (Package and Core Temp), **CPU** Performance, Power, Voltage, Current, Core Parking, Frequency Scaling, System Memory, Turbo Boost, C-States, Speed Shift FIVR Control as well as making other adjustments.


### CPU Z & GPU z

These will allow you to identify the GPU and CPU.


### GEEK Uninstaller

This is a great tool for uninstalling programs and removing any traces they leave behind.


### WINDOWS OPTIMIZATION

As well as the tools i can install and configure there are also some optimizations I can perform inside of Windows itself.

These include.

- Nvidia control panel optimizations

- Bios optimizations.

- Power management optimizations.

- Game-specific optimizations.



### OVERCLOCKING OF THE GPU

I can overclock and stress test your **GPU**.



### As well as all of the above I can.

<summary>Preventing Steam updates</summary>

![img](https://i.imgur.com/gF9VG11.png)

Turn Off Automatic Updates

**1**) In Steam right-click on Hogwarts Legacy

**2**) In the menu that appears, click on Properties.

**3**) In the popup window, select the Updates tab.

**4**) In the selection box under "Automatic Updates", select "Only update this game when I launch it".

**5**) Close the window.


Alternative Solutions

**A**. Lock your Manifest file

**1**)Ensure Steam is closed

**2**)Navigate to [DriveLetter]:\SteamLibrary\steamapps

**3**)Find "appmanifest_1716740"

**4**)Right-click on appmanifest_1716740 and select Properties

**5**)The Properties window should open

**6**) Click on Checkbox for "Read-only"

**7**) Hit Apply

**8**) Hit Ok

Your file should now be locked.
Reopen steam
Remember, When you WANT to update it, you will need to follow this process and instead of enabling (clicking checkbox) you need to disable "Read-only" (uncheck). Then APPLY, Then OK. Then you can proceed with the update


**B**. Launch Steam in Offline Mode or play without an internet connection. This would make you unable to download updates for any of your games but would ensure that your downgraded version isn't accidentally erased by a surprise update.

**Note:**
These alternative solutions will require remembering you initiated these. But these two methods are solid. 

The disabling (making it read-only) of the manifest file will allow steam to not be able to write to disk (your files) for that particular game (manifest ID). You will continue to get this error "Disk-Write error" in Steam, until proceeding with update but that is intended by using this method. It is safe to play via Vortex if you proceed. 

The offline mode comes with its own set of drawbacks, so make sure you know how to use offline mode for Steam if you are going to commit to this option
