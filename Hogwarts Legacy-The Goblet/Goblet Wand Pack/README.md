## FAQ

## [Where is the game located](https://)❓

```
GOG users> Drive Letter\GOGLibrary\Games\Hogwarts Legacy
Steam users> Drive Letter\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Hogwarts Legacy
Epic users> Drive Letter\EpicLibrary\Hogwarts Legacy
```

## [I've installed the collection but my game crashes when I create a character](https://)❓

- This is most likely because you have two or more non-compatible mods enabled ie**MAKEUP**,**CUSTOM PLAYER FACES**,**WANDS**check the mod settings and overview section.

## [My game is crashing ❓ ](https://)

- If you are crashing or items are not working properly this is because you have 2 conflicting mods.  At this stage, there is no way to fix this due to the way the files work in the game. To fix these issues you need to determine which mods are affected and then uninstall one of them.

## [Cleanup](https://) *(recommended after each update)*
